Utility for an easy access of Core Data SQLite databases created in iPhone Simulator.

Features
--------
At this time it only search for sqlite files under `~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator` directory by clicking the icon on the top menu bar.
It builds submenus structure to access found SQLite files.
It expects you have `.sqlite` associated with any SQLite viewer.

Why
---
Because the access via Finder seems little bit obscure and annoying. See, e.g.: http://stackoverflow.com/q/4646692/603878

Name
----
The utility is named after one of my daughters. She is best in search for things I've misplaced somewhere. :-) 

TODO
----
* Search more locations (e.g. iPad simulator)
* Android Emulator support?
